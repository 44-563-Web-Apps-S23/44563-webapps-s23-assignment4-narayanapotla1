    <div class = "TOMBES" ><h6>TOMBES.</h6></div><p><speech> Yes, Sir Harry.</speech></p>

    <div class = "SIRHARRY" ><h6>SIR HARRY.</h6></div><p><speech> Show her in here. <direction>[_He has very lately become a stickler for
    etiquette._]</direction> And, Tombes, strictly speaking, you know, I am not Sir
    Harry till Thursday.</speech></p>
    
    <div class = "TOMBES" ><h6>TOMBES.</h6></div><p><speech> Beg pardon, sir, but it is such a satisfaction to us.</speech></p>
    
    <div class = "SIRHARRY" ><h6>SIR HARRY.</h6></div><p><speech> <direction>[_Good-naturedly._]</direction> Ah, they like it down-stairs, do they?</speech></p>
    
    <div class = "TOMBES" ><h6>TOMBES.</h6></div><p><speech>TOMBES. <direction>[_Unbending._]</direction> Especially the females, Sir Harry.</speech></p>
    
    <div class = "SIRHARRY" ><h6>SIR HARRY.</h6></div><p><speech> Exactly. You can show her in, Tombes. <direction>[_The butler departs on
    his mighty task._]</direction> You can tell the woman what she is wanted for, Emmy,
    while I change. <direction>[_He is too modest to boast about himself, and prefers
    to keep a wife in the house for that purpose._]</direction> You can tell her the
    sort of things about me that will come better from you. <direction>[_Smiling
    happily._]</direction> You heard what Tombes said: "Especially the females." And he
    is right. Success! The women like it even better than the men. And
    rightly. For they share. _You_ share, _Lady_ Sims. Not a woman will see
    that gown without being sick with envy of it. I know them. Have all our
    lady friends in to see it. It will make them ill for a week.</speech></p>
