    <div class = "LADYSIMS" ><h6>LADY SIMS.</h6></div><p><speech> Oh, very. And it will be still more so when you have the
     sword.</speech></p>

     <div class = "SIRHARRY" ><h6>SIR HARRY.</h6></div><p><speech> The sword will lend it an air. There are really the five
     moments--<dirction>[_suiting the action to the word_]</direction>--the glide--the dip--the
     kiss--the tap--and you back out a knight. It's short, but it's a very
     beautiful ceremony. <direction>[_Kindly._]</direction> Anything you can suggest?

    <div class = "LADYSIMS" ><h6>LADY SIMS.</h6></div><p><speech> No--oh, no.<direction>[_Nervously, seeing him pause to kiss the tassel
    of a cushion._]</direction> You don't think you have practised till you know what to
    do almost too well?</speech></p>

     <direction>[_He has been in a blissful temper, but such niggling criticism
     would try any man._] </direction>

     <div class = "SIRHARRY" ><h6>SIR HARRY.</h6></div><p><speech> I do not. Don't talk nonsense. Wait till your opinion is
    asked for.</speech></p>

    <div class = "LADYSIMS" ><h6>LADY SIMS.</h6></div><p><speech> <direction>[_Abashed._] I'm sorry, Harry. [_A perfect butler appears and
    presents a card._]</direction> "The Flora Typewriting Agency."</speech></p>

    <div class = "SIRHARRY" ><h6>SIR HARRY.</h6></div><p><speech> Ah, yes. I telephoned them to send some one. A woman, I
    suppose, Tombes?</speech></p>
